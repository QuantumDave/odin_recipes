This project is about creating a website using only HTML to display my favorite recipes. The site will include different pages or sections for each recipe, with details like ingredients and step-by-step instructions. By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to structure web pages using HTML tags, organize content clearly, and create a simple navigation system.
