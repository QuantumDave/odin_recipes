    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>This toast recipe is as simple as it gets—crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and ready to pair with anything from butter and jam to avocado or eggs. It’s the perfect base for both sweet and savory toppings.</p>
<p>Making good toast is about timing and texture. Whether you use a toaster or a pan, the goal is a golden-brown surface that brings out the bread’s flavor and crunch.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 slices of bread (white, whole grain, or your choice)</li>
  <li>Optional: butter, jam, or other toppings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place the bread slices into a toaster or on a heated skillet.</li>
  <li>Toast until golden brown, adjusting the time to your preferred level of crispiness.</li>
  <li>If using a skillet, flip the slices halfway through to toast both sides evenly.</li>
  <li>Remove from heat and spread butter or any toppings while still warm.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately while the toast is crisp and fresh.</li>
</ol>
